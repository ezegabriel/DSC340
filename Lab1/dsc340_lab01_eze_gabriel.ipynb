    "# DSC 340 Lab 1: Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab provides a review of skills you developed in DSC 270 and CSC 170 including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Jupyter Notebook environment. \n",
    "* Essential Python programming skills:\n",
    "  * functions, \n",
    "  * nested loops, \n",
    "  * math operations, and \n",
    "  * importing packages. \n",
    "* NumPy and Pandas.\n",
    "  * While it is not too difficult to complete this assignment in plain Python, most students find it much easier to complete if they take full advantage of the Pandas and NumPy packages.\n",
    "  * Note, however, that you *must* write a Python function to successfully complete this project.\n",
    "* Importing and working with a simple data set to answer questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lab also asks you to **communicate** your work in writing. Keep in mind that this Jupyter Notebook is not only a work environment in which to develop and run your code, but a presentation of your work. \n",
    "\n",
    "## _Overview_\n",
    "\n",
    "_To become an effective data scientist, you need extensive practice. Labs&mdash;weekly analytics assignments done outside of class&mdash;are an opportunity to strengthen your understanding of applied machine learning and other analytic methods.  While the value of each lab as a percent of your final grade is relatively small, the wisdom and experience you will gain from doing each lab will significantly help you on your tests and further career in data science and analytics._\n",
    "\n",
    "_The first lab is an introduction to the Jupyter Notebook environment and a review of fundamental programming skills in Python3. In most future labs, you will write code and analyze data in collaboration with a lab partner&mdash;and then independently write your report. **The first lab, however, is meant for you to do independently**&mdash;perhaps with some help from your instructor. We will be using the Jupyter environment for all of our labs and for the final project, so it is important that you are comfortable working in this environment._\n",
    "\n",
    "## _General instructions_\n",
    "\n",
    "_Your work will consist of code (in Code cells) and corresponding output, as well as formatted text (in Markdown cells).  In your lab reports, you will alternate between text exposition and code, sometimes with output in text or graphics.  You will describe what you are doing, provide the code to do it, and make observations.  A major advantage of the Jupyter Notebook type environment is that it allows you to submit your code, analytic work, and discussion as a single document that tells a \"story\" describing your work._\n",
    "\n",
    "* _First, rename your file:_  \n",
    "\n",
    "  * _Replace the word `instructions` with your last name, an underscore, and your first name._ \n",
    "  * _The `.ipynb` extension specifies that the file is an iPython (Jupyter) notebook file._ \n",
    "  * _Filename should be all lowercase.  So, if your name is Yennefer of Vengerberg, your file name would be_ `dsc305_lab01_vengerberg_yennefer.ipynb`. \n",
    "  * _This will be your file format for all future labs._ \n",
    "\n",
    "* _The files you start with include problems in **bold text**.  Solve each problem, explain your work, and analyze your results. Leave the instructions in place to help organize your work and to help me know which problem your are solving._\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Your code should be readable and should have occasional helpful comments._\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Alternate your code with Markdown cells describing what you are doing and summarizing your results._\n",
    "\n",
    "* _The starter files contain additional instructions in_ italics _that you should delete before submitting your solution._ \n",
    "\n",
    "* _Once you have completed the assignment, upload your file along with ALL data files that you import from a local directory. Your submission should include everything I need to recompile (run) it from start to finish. If any cell shows an error message or warning, you will receive a reduced score._\n",
    "\n",
    "_Be sure to follow the instructions carefully for the labs. By following the instructions, you make it easier for me to assess your lab and get prompt feedback to everyone in time for your work on the subsequent lab. If you do not follow the instructions&mdash;even small things such as filenames or including data files&mdash;you will receive a reduced score._\n",
